                <h3>Where do color meanings come from?</h3>
                <p>Millions of years of biological conditioning have created certain associations between colors and
                    objects or emotions, while some associations may be more recent. Understanding these associations
                    will give you a shortcut to people’s hearts, provoking a specific emotion and maybe even a behavior.
                    Feelings are much more powerful than rational thoughts based on facts and figures and applying color
                    meanings and color symbolism will make your branding efforts and designs much more effective.</p>

                <p>Color meanings stem from psychological effects, biological conditioning and cultural developments.
                    Some color meanings are deeply rooted in our brains because they’re visible all around us, like red
                    as the color of fire being associated with warmth or green with nature. We’re biologically wired to
                    pay attention to bright colors because brightly colored animals or plants are often poisonous. We’re
                    drawn to red fruit over green fruit because the color indicates ripeness and sweetness.</p>

                <p>Other colors have developed cultural meaning over time and their meanings have been adopted by
                    society, such as pink as a color for girls and blue for boys in Western cultures (which hasn’t
                    always been the case).</p>

                <h3>Cultural differences</h3>
                <p>Red represents good luck in China but in South Africa it’s the color of mourning. Americans associate
                    green with money as that’s the color of dollar bills but that isn’t the case globally. Black is the
                    color of mourning in Western countries, while in some East Asian countries it’s white. In the US
                    green is the color of envy, while in Germany it’s yellow.</p>

                <h3>Time</h3>
                <p>Colors may also change in significance over time: red used to be seen as a strong, masculine color
                    while blue was a feminine color suited for girls.</p>
                <h3>Shades<span>&</span>tones</h3>
                <p>A color may have a general meaning, but lighter shades can vary dramatically compared to darker
                    shades, while more natural, muted shades will differ from artificial neon colors. Make sure that you
                    look at the specific associations of the different shades and tones. For example, if you’re using
                    neon green, don’t assume that just because you’ve chosen a shade of green it’s going to be a good
                    fit for an eco-friendly brand. </p>

                <p> If you’re using more than one color you need to be aware of how color combinations affect the
                    overall meaning. They can enhance each other, make each other pop, blend together or fight with each
                    other. You’ll need to give some thought to their combined meanings and what effect you want to
                    achieve with your combination. Color theory will help you understand the relationships between
                    colors.</p>

                <p>Yellow is the color of the sun, smiley faces and sunflowers. It’s a happy, youthful color, full of
                    hope and positivity. It’s another color that grabs your attention and for that reason can also be
                    used to signify caution, like red and orange.</p>

                <h3>What red means:</h3>
                <p>Red is associated with the heat of energy, passion and love. We “see red” when we’re angry and it’s
                    also the color of blood, power and danger, making it a powerful color in branding. Think of the bold
                    red of a fireman’s truck or the ‘stop’ sign in traffic.</p>

                <h3>What orange means:</h3>

                    yellow. It attracts attention without being as daring as red, and is used for warning signs like
                    traffic cones and high-visibility clothing. </p>
